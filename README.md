# Sad Browser V2 JavaScript Edition

I made it with javascript now

powered by the Electron Framework

``` bash 
npm install -y electron
```

## How to run the browser 

```Javascript 

npm start

```

The browser window should be on your screen after this comand, first it will be on a smaller scale but the browser should resize automatically on mouse click ajust window.
